# Moodify- Your Smart Diary

## Sumary
This project is our attempt in the atWare Minathon 2022 challange.Moodify acts as your personal online diary, a friend that you can share your feelings with. With a comprehensive web surface, machine learning-oriented framework, it allows you to interact with it via a full-fledged real-feel diary you can type or just by deciphering current mood via your facial expression. As a companion, it suggests encouraging items, videos, or expressive statements based on your input to keep on your happy feel and steer clear of being under the weather. This is truly a product we think that can empower people thru hard times and potentially saving lives for those who have mental disabilities. And we would be thrilled to demonstrate our minimum viable product to you all right now.

Despite not being able to win any prizes but we had a lot of fun when doing this project.
